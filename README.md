# Synthosphere
Synthosphere is a verilog hackathon which involves writing a verilog code to describe circuit behaviour (pre-synthesis) and hen translating it into an optimized gate-level representation (post-synthesis) using synthesis tools.

# PWM generator with variable duty cycle
Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a technique used to precisely control analog devices with a digital signal. A pulse width modulation signal consists of electronic pulses that are used to mimic a changing analog voltage. Pulse width modulation signals are commonly used to control analog devices like servos, LEDs, and DC motors. Projects using these devices need a varying voltage to control the position, brightness, or speed of the device. But most microcontrollers are unable to generate this varying analog voltage. Pulse width modulation is used to simulate this varying analog voltage using a digital microcontroller or timer.
# Duty cycle
The ratio of the pulse width to the cycle duration is called the duty cycle.
